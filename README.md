A core for the Mister FPGA (DE-10 Nano SoC) project developed as an exercise to learn how to:
 - Output video the VGA/HDMI
 - Load a font from a file living on the CPU portion of the SoC to the FPGA using HPS
 - Interface with the SDRAM module and test reading and writing to a range of addresses
 - Simulate the core using Verilator
